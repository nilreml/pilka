# pilka ðŸ”© (WIP)


Pilka is a cross-platform democoding tool for creating shader* demos,
similar to [Bonzomatic](https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic) or [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife). Supports hot-reloading which means
resources is checked, updated in the background.

Available features:
 
- [X] Hot-reload
- [X] Saving shaders
- [X] Taking screenshot
- [ ] Record video

- `F11`:  Take Screenshot
- `F12`:  Start/Stop record video
- `ESC`:  Exit the application
- `Arrows`: Change `Pos`

## Parameters

(per-draw-update)

- position: vec3
- time: float
- resolution: vec2
- mouse: vec2

## Requirements

Vulkan SDK is required.

On recent macOS, to allow sound input to be captured (for FFT textures to be generated), you need to: Open up System Preferences, click on Security & Privacy, click on the Privacy tab then click on the Microphone menu item. Make sure Bonzomatic.app is in the list and ticked... 
erm, probably. I don't have macOS.

## Installation

```Bash
cargo install pilka
```

You also can install the application by to downloading the source code
and build locally.

```Bash
# or through ssh git@github.com:pudnax/pilka.git
git clone https://github.com/pudnax/pilka.git
