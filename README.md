# pilka ðŸ”© (WIP)


Pilka is a cross-platform democoding tool for creating shader* demos,
similar to [Bonzomatic](https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic) or [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife). Supports hot-reloading which means
resources is checked, updated in the background.

Available features:

- [X] Hot-reload
- [X] Saving shaders
- [X] Taking screenshot
- [ ] Record video

## Controls

- `F1`:   Toggles play/pause
- `F2`:   Pauses and steps back one frame
- `F3`:   Pauses and steps forward one frame
- `F4`:   Restarts playback at frame 0 (`Time` and `Pos` = 0)
- `F5`:   Print parameters
- `F10`:  Save shaders
- `F11`:  Take Screenshot
- `F12`:  Start/Stop record video
- `ESC`:  Exit the application
- `Arrows`: Change `Pos`

## Parameters

(per-draw-update)

- position: vec3
- time: float
- resolution: vec2
- mouse: vec2

## Requirements

Vulkan SDK is required.

On recent macOS, to allow sound input to be captured (for FFT textures to
be generated), you need to: Open up System Preferences, click on Security
& Privacy, click on the Privacy tab then click on the Microphone menu item.
Make sure `pilka` is in the list and ticked...
erm, probably. I don't have macOS.

## Installation

```Bash
cargo install pilka
```

You also can install the application by to downloading the source code
and build locally.

```Bash
# or through ssh git@github.com:pudnax/pilka.git
git clone https://github.com/pudnax/pilka.git
cd pilka
cargo install --path .
```

## Dependencies

[winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) is the "default" window library in Rust ecosystem. And it covers
the most of cross-platform issues for you.

[RustFFT](https://crates.io/crates/rustfft) is used to perform Fast FFT for generating textures.

[cpal](https://crates.io/crates/cpal) is used to capture sound from microphone and probably MIDI devices
in the future.

[png](https://crates.io/crates/png) is used to encode screenshots into png files.
[notify](https://crates.io/crates/notify) is a file watcher and maintains the hot-reload.

[shaderc](https://crates.io/crates/shaderc) is used to compile GLSL shaders on the runtime instead of opening
a process with glslc or glslangValidator.

[ash](https://crates.io/crates/ash) is a Vulkan bindings. I choose `ash` because I see `pilka` as a
learning project and want to touch the maximum untouched Vulkan. For the
same reason I didn't use `vulkano`, `erupt`, `vulkanism`, etc.
